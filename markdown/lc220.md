220. Contains Duplicate III   
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the difference between i and j is at most k.

######1. Bucket Sort & Window Slide
Width of bucket is t+1, for example is t=2 and nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
we will construct 3 buckets, [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7], so each two element pair in a same bucket will satisfy that abs(v1-v2)<=t; and since the length of window is k, for these k elements each pair satisfy that abs(index1-index2)<=k

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums, k, t):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :type t: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if t<0:
            return False
        bucket = {}
        width = t+1
        
        for i,num in enumerate(nums):
            bucket_id = nums[i]/width
            if bucket_id in bucket:
                return True
            if bucket_id - 1 in bucket and abs(nums[i]-bucket[bucket_id-1]) <= t:
                return True
            if bucket_id + 1 in bucket and abs(nums[i]-bucket[bucket_id+1]) <= t:
                return True
            bucket[bucket_id] = num
            
            if i>=k:
                del bucket[nums[i-k]/width]
        return False
```
