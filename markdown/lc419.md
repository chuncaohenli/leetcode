419. Battleships in a Board

You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

Example:
X..X
...X
...X
In the above board there are 2 battleships.
Invalid Example:
...X
XXXX
...X
This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.

Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?

######1. Modify the board
Every time we ecounter a 'X', we mark its 'X' neighbors to '1'. So when we meet '1' we will jump over it. A little bit like DFS.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def countBattleships(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        result = 0
        i = 0
        while i<len(board):
            j = 0
            while j<len(board[0]):
                if board[i][j] == '1':
                    continue #jump
                if board[i][j] == 'X':
                    result += 1
                    #check right
                    right = j+1
                    while right<len(board[0]) and board[i][right] == 'X':
                        board[i][right] = 1
                        right += 1
                    #check down
                    down = i+1
                    while down<len(board) and board[down][j] == 'X':
                        board[down][j] = 1
                        down += 1
                j+=1
            i+=1
        return result
                    
```
Store words into dictionary, abviously not a good idea

######2. Do not modify the board
Actually we do not need to change the value of the board. For position [x][y], if [x][y-1] == 'X' or [x-1][y] == 'X', it must be part of the exist battle or a '.' position. 
```Java
public class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int row = board.length;
        int col = board[0].length;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<row;i++){
            for (int j=0; j<col;j++){
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                if (i>0 && board[i-1][j]=='X') continue;
                if (j>0 && board[i][j-1]=='X') continue;
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
