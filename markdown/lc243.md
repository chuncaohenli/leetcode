243. Shortest Word Distance

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

######1. O(n) time, O(n) space
First solution coming into mind:
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestDistance(self, words, word1, word2):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        dic = {}
        for i,w in enumerate(words):
            if w not in dic:
                dic[w] = [i]
            else:
                dic[w].append(i)
        result = sys.maxint
        
        if word1==word2:
            return -1
        
        for v1 in dic[word1]:
            for v2 in dic[word2]:
                result = min(result,abs(v1-v2))
        return result
```
Store words into dictionary, abviously not a good idea

######2. Two pointers, O(n) time, O(1) space
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestDistance(self, words, word1, word2):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        p1=p2=-1
        result = sys.maxint
        
        for i,w in enumerate(words):
            if w==word1:
                p1 = i
            if w==word2:
                p2 = i
            if p1!=-1 and p2!=-1:
                result = min(result,abs(p1-p2))
        return result
```
######3. One pointer, O(n) time, O(1) space
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestDistance(self, words, word1, word2):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        p=-1
        result = sys.maxint
        
        for i,w in enumerate(words):
            if w==word1 or w==word2:
                if p!=-1 and words[i] != words[p]:
                    result = min(result,abs(p-i))
                p=i
        return result
```
