#LC11 Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.

###1. Brute Force, O(n^2)


###2. Shrink from start and end O(n)

Calculate Area(0,n-1) first, then if there exists larger area, the new line must longer than min(height[0],height[n-1])

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def getArea(left,right):
            return (right-left) * min(height[left],height[right])
        
        if len(height)<1:
            return 0
            
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        area = getArea(left,right)
        while left < right:
            area = max(area,getArea(left,right))
            minh = min(height[left],height[right])
            while height[left] <= minh and left < right:
                left += 1
            while height[right] <= minh and left < right:
                right -= 1
        return area
```
