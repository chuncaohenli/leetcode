127. Word Ladder   
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
For example,

Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Note:
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

######1. BFS
Using same [search schema](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/) will cause TLE, so we construct neigbor in this way

```
for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
    next = head[:i] + c + head[i+1:] 
```
first.

And pay attention to reduce the search space

```
if next in wordList:
    wordList.remove(next)
```

Full code
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: Set[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        bfsq = [beginWord]
        level = 0
        wordList.add(endWord)
        wordList.discard(beginWord)

        while bfsq:
            for i in range(len(bfsq)):
                tmp = []
                head = bfsq[0]
                bfsq = bfsq[1:]
                
                for i in range(len(head)):
                    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                        next = head[:i] + c + head[i+1:] 
                        if next in wordList:
                            wordList.remove(next)
                            if next == endWord:
                                return level + 2
                            else:
                                bfsq.append(next)
            level += 1
        return 0
```
